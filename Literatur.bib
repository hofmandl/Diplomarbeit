The asymmetry of the opponents' decision processes leads to a new and delicate generalization of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in stochastic control. We characterize the optimal controls in general and specify them further in the cases of Hara, logarithmic, and exponential utilities of the investor.}",

Our main assumption is that upper bounds for both the crash size and the number of crashes occurring before the time horizon are given. We make no probabilistic assumption on the crash size or the crash time distribution. The optimal strategies in the presence of a crash possibility are characterized by a balance problem between insurance against the crash and good performance in the crash-free situation. Explicit solutions for the log-utility case are given. Our main finding is that constant portfolios are no longer optimal ones.}",

The optimal portfolios are derived as solutions of non-linear differential equations which itself are consequences of a Bellman principle for worst-case bounds. A particular application of our setting is to model crash scenarios where both the number and the height of the crash are uncertain but bounded. Also the situation of changing market coefficients after a possible crash is analyzed.}",
